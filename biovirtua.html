            <h3> My Role</h3>
            <br>
            <p1>I joined Biovirtua, a startup focused on delivering telehealth care through augmented reality. After talking to the CEO and some of their founders, I was excited to work with them. They focused on steady progress with measurable outcomes instead of complete disruption in the field — a smart move in a field marred with regulation. Coming from a background as a project manager in cardiology software documentation, I brought my expertise of working with physicians and experience with watching them interact with technology in their clinical workflows. </p1>
            <br>
            <p1>  I started as a product management associate. As I developed more of the product, I became the product management lead. I am responsible for determining the direction of product development, conducting user experience research, developing the design of the interfaces, and ensuring that both the UI/UX and R&amp;D are hitting research and development milestones. </p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <br>
            <p1>Create a movement analysis dashboard for clinicians to record patient movement and review analysis. </p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <br>
            <p1>I first needed to gain an understanding of the whole neurology clinical workflow, not just as it pertains to telehealth. I wanted to know:</p1>

            <ol>
              <li>How do they interact with patients?</li>
              <li>What information do they need to look up in the patient’s chart?</li>
              <li> How do they interact with their electronic health record, or other equipment?</li>
              <li>What are some of the pain-points that exist within their current workflow?</li>
              <li>I targeted some physicians for in-depth interviews about their day to day workflows while I slowly mapped out a basic neurology workflow. </li>
            </ol>

            <img src="biovirtua/workflow.jpg" class="img-fluid"/>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p1>After extensive talks with the other members of the team, we found that we wanted to focus on one neurology expertise in particular — stroke patients. We wanted to look at how stroke patients received inpatient, outpatient care, and post acute care, and how Biovirtua could fit within the existing workflow. </p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Design </h3>
            <br>
            <h5>Low Fidelity Prototype </h5>
            <br>
            <p1>I started with creating a basic user flow for a physician’s followup visit for a stroke patient, and included areas where Biovirtua could be present. I made sure to incorporate how other healthcare technologies would remain in their workflows as part of the user flow. I got feedback from the user flows from one of the members of our team who is a neurology resident.</p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="biovirtua/wireframe1.jpg" class="img-fluid"/>
            <br>
            <p1>I created low fidelity mockups. I broke down the basic components of each of the different frames and considered options for how physicians can filter the information presented in the interfaces. 

              I interacted with the Hololens, an augmented reality headset, to understand how interactive features such as gestures, placement, eye level could start to influence a physician’s surroundings. I found a space that closely mimicked a physicians office to determine how best to incorporate Biovirtua’s interfaces without duplicating information in the electronic health records or adding to their alert fatigue. </p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="biovirtua/wireframe2.jpg" class="img-fluid"/>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5> Medium Fidelity Mockups</h5>
            <br>
            <p1>I started to create medium fidelity mock ups. I had weekly meetings with our R&amp;D team to determine how captured data can be used for graphical trending. We discussed how gesture controls and voice activation could come into play. Using prior knowledge from my project manager years, I also thought about what information could be interfaced over to Biovirtua to make it easier for physicians to retrieve appropriate information when they were viewing patient recordings. </p1>
            <br>
            <p1>I also designed where these interfaces would display in the augmented reality headset. In the high fidelity mockups, I added additional configuration tools for physicians after hearing that some had issues with being able to save important information to reference later. This was important because physicians only see patients once every 6 months, and they needed tools so that they could save and view the most important information quickly.
            </p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5> High Fidelity Prototype </h5>
            <br>
            <p1> After testing out the Microsoft hololens, I found its important that the interfaces are anchored to a readable height by calculating the height of the ceiling when you first put it on. As a physician who needs to have access to the patient chart, the Biovirtua screens need to be pretty high so that they can still see their computer with no obstructions.</p1>
            <br>
            <p1>What the patient list will look like in the AR headset (the sillhouette would be the patient hologram):</p1>
